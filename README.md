# Packet Cafe Design

This project is built using Framer Bridge which is a suite of tools:

- That allows you to automatically publish and distribute components to Packet Cafe designers with [Framer](https://framer.com) and the [Framer Store](https://store.framer.com).
- Import in production components built by Packet Cafe engineers. It‚Äôs an automatic and continually synced workflow, one that is customizable to your existing development workflow.

This repository uses [folder backed Framer projects](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/folder-backed-projects/) with the [Framer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-cli) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for an easy package publication flow.

## üèÅ Getting started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies in the root directory

Inside the repository directory, you will find two key folders:

- **[`design-system`](/design-system):** contains production components. Typically, this design system is consumed by multiple projects. This is where we put our React Components.
- **[`design-system.framerfx`](/design-system.framerfx):** a [folder backed project](https://framer.gitbook.io/teams/integrations#folder-projects) that imports the components from [`design-system`](/design-system) and (optionally) adds [interface properties](https://www.framer.com/api/property-controls/) to use in Framer X.
- **[`deployable-prototype`](/deployable-prototype):** a folder that holds an exported web preview of the project

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Editing

From here, you can continue modifying the existing [`design-system.framerfx`](/design-system.framerfx) file. If you edit any of the components in [`design-system`](/design-system), they will automatically get updated in Framer too.

## Troubleshooting

If you're unable to install packages for the project, be sure to 
```
npx framer-cli help
```

You might have to authenticate your folder-backed Framer X project with your Framer username.

```
npx framer-cli authenticate <email.address>
```
